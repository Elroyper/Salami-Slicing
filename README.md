# 🤖 Multi-Model Black-box Jailbreak Framework Suite 🛡️

> **Security Research Toolbox Built on Salami Slicing Methodology**

## 📦 Overview

This repository contains two advanced security research frameworks focused on Large Language Model safety assessment and red-team testing:

- **Salami Attack** 🚀 - Innovative **Salami Slicing** progressive attack framework
- **A-Salami Attack** 🔧 - Modern **adaptive multi-turn** attack system

## 🎯 Core Value

- **Progressive Attack Strategy** 🔄: Gradually evolve innocent prompts to potentially harmful outputs
- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation** 📊: Combines success rates, score-based, and safety assessments
- **High-performance Processing** ⚡: Parallel testing for large-scale datasets
- **Flexible Model Integration** 🔗: Support for mainstream APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic

## 🔑 Key Features

- **🛡️ Security Integration**: Built-in safety review mechanisms
- **📈 Diverse Evaluation**: Triple-judge, score-based, and classification testing
- **⚡ Parallel Acceleration**: Thread pool concurrent processing
- **🎨 Modular Design**: Flexible extensible architecture
- **📋 Complete Reports**: Automatically generated reproducible JSON results

## 🔬 Use Cases

- **Academic Security Research** 🎓: Model robustness evaluation
- **Enterprise Red-team Testing** 🏢: Security vulnerability discovery
- **Model Safety Certification** ✅: Pre-deployment security validation
- **Continuous Monitoring** 📊: Production environment safety detection

## ⚖️ Compliance Statement

**Authorized security testing and research only**. Prohibited for malicious purposes. Users must ensure compliance with relevant API service terms.
